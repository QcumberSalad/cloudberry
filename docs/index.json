    "body": "This cake is a mission to make, with many steps, but, after making it, everyone agreed it was worth the effort. Th eoriginal was a bit sweet for me, so next time I want to use some adjustments to get the sugar content down a notch.\nKiev cake Adapted from Let the Baking Begin Ingredients Kiev cake 1 recipe Yellow cake 1 recipe Russian buttercream 0.5 recipe meringue cookies 1 cup chopped roasted hazelnuts 1/2 cup roasted, canned or frozen cherries\nGanache - pour hot cream over chocolate chips and let it sit for 2 minutes, stir till homogenous 3 Tbsp chocolate chips 3 Tbsp cream\nSoaking syrup - microwave sugar and water till dissolved, stirring regularly, then add vanilla 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup water 1 Tbsp vanilla\nTo make hazelnut meringues Combine 2 egg whites, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/3 cup sugar in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Mix on high for about 15 minutes. Using a star tipped nozzle, pipe meringue onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle hazelnuts onto meringues, coating them with as much as will stick. Dry in the oven at 100 degrees celsius for 2 to 2.5 hours or until meringues are completely dry in the centre. open the oven slightly and place a wooden spoon in the opening. Allow meringues to cool for 30 minutes then remove from the oven to cool completely These meringues freeze well in an airtight container and it is recommended to make these in advance to ease the work of baking and assembling the cake.\n*Assemble the cake Place the first cake layer upside down onto a serving plate dabbed with a layer of buttercream to secure the cake. Reserve about 1.5 cups of icing for the outside of the cake. Sprinkle the cake layer with half the soaking syrup and spread about 1/2 cup of icing on the cake layer. Take the meringues and dip them into buttercream, collecting as much frosting as will stick, and stick them to the cake layer. Arrange the meringes till no spaces remain on the cake and crumble remaining meringues to fill remaining crevices. Sprinkle the cherries and remaining hazelnuts over the meringue layer. Take the other cake layer and soak it in the remaining syrup. Spread the rest of the buttercream (not that reserved for the top) on the syrup side of the layer and stick it frosting-side-down onto the cherries. Cover the cake with the frosting reserved at the beginning and refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour. Prepare the ganache and allow it to cool to a spreadible consistency. Pour it over the cake, spreading the ganache so that it runs down the sides of the cake. Top the cake with the remaining meringues and chopped hazelnuts, if desired. Refrigerate for at least 3 more hours To cut cake, take a long, thin knife and warm it, cut a slice and wipe the knife. repeat with every slice.\nOriginal recipe calls for a yellow sponge but I used a one bowl yellow cake - to me a bit rubbery, but made good layers for the ingredients used. I still want to find a good yellow sponge.\n",
